having to run
"pod repo update"
after installing nativescript-iqkeyboardmanager

1. tns platform add ios@next
this makes sure no memory leak

cd platform/ios
run pod update instead of pod install beacuse pod install check only existing pod and pod update reinstall all pods.

2. run tns prepare ios --release brefore ios release, this will get rid oerror

or run: tns publish ios - DO NOT USE THIS ONE, it is not prod mode at all
